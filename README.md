Field Vector Shadow Framework

# FVS Framework â€” Field Â· Vector Â· Shadow

**One-line:** ðŸŒŠ â†’ ðŸŽ¯ â†’ âœ§  
The **field** flows (superposition of possibilities).  
The **vector** presses (your chosen frame/measurement).  
The **shadow** appears (a provisional answer). The field remains.

FVS is a practical reasoning pattern for AI (and humans): **hold uncertainty (field), choose frames deliberately (vector), expose projections with confidence (shadow).** It changes *how you stage decisions*, not your math.

## Why it matters
- **Safer decisions:** donâ€™t collapse to one answer too early; show alternatives and confidence.
- **Clearer thinking:** name the frame you used; offer re-measurement with a different frame.
- **Works today:** build fields from multiple drafts, vectors from policy+landmarks+retrieval, shadows as chosen outputs.

## Quick picture
- **Field:** weighted set of hypotheses \{háµ¢, wáµ¢\}.
- **Vector:** compiled from prompt + policy + cues (landmarks) + retrieved facts.
- **Shadow:** chosen answer + confidence + top alternatives (and why they were excluded).
